# Tower of Hanoi - Implemented in C
This is an implementation of the classic algorithm *Tower of Hanoi*, in its full glory in the C programming language.

## The Game
Tower of Hanoi game can be read on [the Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi). I would do a lousy job trying to beat their explanation :).

## The Build and Install Options from the Makefile
The Makefile has currently these options:
- all: builds and runs the main application 
- run: just runs the Tower of Hanoi game
- test_hanoi: builds the main executable file
- test: tests all the components, based on TDD approach
- clean: removes object and binary files
- install: installs the game in the bin folder
- uninstall: uninstalls the game
